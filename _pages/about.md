I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, working under the guidance of <a href="https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/ronald-metoyer/" style="color: #0C2340; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Dr. Ronald Metoyer</a> and
<a href="https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/karla-badillo-urquiola/" style="color: #0C2340; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Dr. Karla Badillo-Urquiola</a>. Before coming to Notre Dame, I earned an MS in Computer Science from Boise State University (BSU), where I was part of the <a href="https://piret.info/" style="color: #0C2340; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank"> People and Information Research team</a>.

My research intersects Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence, where I use human-centered methods to design, develop, and evaluate socio-technical systems aimed at improving knowledge management and support for marginalized and vulnerable groups. I use ethnography and participatory design research methodologies to ensure these systems are community-driven and impactful. I am also passionate about enhancing AI and technology literacy for underserved communities in the Global South, especially Africa. I have disseminated my research through presentations and publications at leading academic conferences across HCI and related interdisciplinary fields, including CHI, IDC, ICSE, and FAccT.
