I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://hci.nd.edu/" style="color: #b37f20; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Human Computer Interaction Lab</a> at the University of Notre Dame, and co-advised by <a href="https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/ronald-metoyer/" style="color: #b37f20; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Dr. Ronald Metoyer</a> and
<a href="https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/karla-badillo-urquiola/" style="color: #b37f20; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Dr. Karla Badillo-Urquiola</a>. Before coming to Notre Dame, I earned an MS in Computer Science from Boise State University (BSU), where I was a member of the <a href="https://piret.info/" style="color: #b37f20; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">People and Information Research Team</a>.

My work falls in the intersection of **HCI,** **human-AI collaboration,**  **AI ethics,** and **social welfare,** and focuses on the empowerment of underserved and marginalized groups, including children, low-income communities, and other vulnerable populations, through digital solutions. My current research uses **ethnography** and **participatory design methodologies** to explore challenges and needs in the work processes of community workers supporting underserved and marginalized groups, and to design, implement, and evaluate AI-powered knowledge management interventions that strengthen support systems for these populations. Additionally, I am passionate about **enhancing AI literacy** in the Global South, with a special emphasis on Africa. My research findings have been disseminated through presentations and publications at leading academic conferences across HCI and related interdisciplinary fields, including CHI, IDC, ICSE, and FAccT.

My research has been generously funded by the <a href = "https://www.dupontfund.org/" style="color: #b37f20; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Jessie Ball duPont Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/" style="color: #b37f20; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a>.
