I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, working under the guidance of Dr. Ronald Metoyer and Dr. Karla Badillo-Urquiola. Before coming to Notre Dame, I earned an MS in Computer Science from Boise State University (BSU), where I was part of the People and Information Research team.

My research intersects Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence, focusing on designing AI-empowered interventions to improve knowledge management and support for marginalized and vulnerable groups. I use ethnography and participatory design research methodologies to ensure these systems are community-driven and impactful. I am also passionate about enhancing AI and technology literacy, especially in underserved communities in the Global South, aiming to democratize technology access and use. I have published and presented my research at top-tier academic venues, including CHI, IDC, FaaCT, and COMPASS.
